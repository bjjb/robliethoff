        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        
        <p>Robert Liethoff is an actor, director and voice movement teacher from
        the Netherlands After finishing his acting school (degree in 2005
        Acting Studio The Hague) he moved to Berlin and expanded his studies
        in the field of dance and choreography.</p>
        
        <p>From 2007 until recently he has been studying and working at the
        Lichtenberg Institute for advanced study in applied physiology of the
        voice.</p>
        
        <p>His work draws on the aspects of voice physiology as a departure point
        for the development of sound-oriented body work. Can our voice unfold
        into a warm, sound-enriched and effortless energetic instrument?</p>
        
        <p>Using an interdisciplinary approach to the voice he has been teaching
        and working with classical singers, choirs / bands, actors /
        performers in the Netherlands, Germany and Mexico over the past few
        years. He is currently collaborating with DJ’s and sound composers in
        Berlin and Amsterdam brainstorming new modalities of listening and
        composing electronic music through an acoustic experience of the body.</p>

        <h2>The body as a sound system.</h2>
        
        <p>Do we know what voice is? How do voice and body interact during the
        act of singing, making sounds and speaking? Can we perceive ourselves
        as playable instruments where voice and physicality enhance each
        other?</p>
        
        <p>This work is based on the method from the Lichtenberger Institute for
        Applied Physiology of the Voice. It draws considerable attention to an
        understanding of the sensory relationship between nervous system and
        the sound of the voice, as well to a healthy vocal functioning.</p>
        
        <p>Through preparing the body for a state of receptivity we will
        delicately establish contact with our inner ears and our larynx while
        awakening the deeper tissues of the vocal chords. Perceiving and
        listening instead of expressing outwardly - tuning in, not out - will
        play a major role in this process. We’ll seek the minimum amount of
        energy needed for a fine oscillation to be present in our tone.</p>
        
        <p>Can we play with the idea that a tone starts &#39;as a spark&#39; in between
        our ears?  Can we learn to trust the higher frequencies of the
        overtones to enrich the quality of our sound? How efficient can we
        become? In short: instead of using exercises to control the voice we
        focus on how to be guided by sound sensory perception.</p>
        
        <p>We could see this practice as a space for inquiry. Therefore essential
        are: patience, openness and willingness to let go of the urge to
        achieve something. </p>
